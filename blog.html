							<h3> Starting page </h3>
							<p> In this page, i have explained about how i have made all webpages for this website. For creating it i have used, html and css only. 
							<br>
							Firstly in home.html, I created a simple background, then using css responsive navigation bar was created. Inside navigation bar i have included my page logo, home, portfolio, contact, blog and sitereport pages link. When the web page is resized and is displayed in smaller size it automatically shows ham burger icon in the navigation bar. When the hambirger icon is clicked it shows all the link pages.
							Onces you click the page link it will take you to the selected page.
							Once you hover on "HELLO" it will show the introduction of the page.
							<br><br>

							After making home page i created portfolio page, which includes six boxes. I have used grid on this webpage. While resizing the page it will show the boxes in an order and willnot overlap eachother. 

							<br><br>

							Inside blog page, i have included some picture to make the page more pleasant. This page is all about how i created my portfolio website and what other things i have included in it. This page is mainly about the description of each webpages. 

							<br><br>

							In contact page, it has contact form for the users. 
							It accepts the user name, email address and can write about what user think about this page.
							Atlast i have, included send button.

							<br><br>

							Inside sitereport page, i have included brief introduction about html and css. It included all the screenshots of the page and the source code of the webpages with some information in it.
